# Stock Tracker
Quick python program to scrape marketwatch.com for my stocks and then for each stock, display:

- The stock's name
- How many shares I own
- The value per share
- Total profit from that stock

I created a "Stock" class, so it is easy to change values if I ever end up buying more of a stock.

### To Add:
- Make a "Portfolio" class so I can keep track of multiple portfolios at once
- Create functions for selling stock (I have never sold stock so I don't need this feature yet)
